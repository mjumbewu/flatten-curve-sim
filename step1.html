    I saw [this article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) with a social
    distancing simulator on Washington Post (I don't remember who shared it, but whoever it was thank you!). I
    thought it would be fun to recreate!

    First, let's set up some styles for our simulation boards, which will be canvases.

    ```css
    .world {
      border: 2px solid black;
    }
    ```
  -->

  <style>
    #worldcanvas {
      border: 2px solid black;
    }
  </style>

  <!-- Now, our simulation worlds are going to look something like this: -->

  <canvas width="600" height="300" id="worldcanvas"></canvas>
</body>
