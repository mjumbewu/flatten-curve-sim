    That's not very exciting â€” it's just an empty simulation world. But now comes the _fun_ part! Let's create a
    couple of core structures that are going to help us manage the simulation:

    * `Agent`: In each simulation there are a number of individual actors. Each one of these actors is an `Agent`
    * `World`: We'll use this structure to keep track of all the pices of the simulation, and tell all the individual
      pieces what "time" it is.

  <script>
    class Agent {
      constructor(x, y) {
        this.state = {x, y}
      }
    }

    class World {
      constructor(canvas, agents=[]) {
        this.canvas = canvas
        this.agents = agents
      }

      addAgent(agent) {
        this.agents.push(agent)
        return this
      }

      draw() {
        const [w, h] = [this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height]

        let ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d')
        ctx.clearRect(0, 0, w, h)
        for (const agent of this.agents) {
          const x = agent.state.x
          const y = agent.state.y
          const r = 3

          ctx.beginPath()
          ctx.arc(x, y, r, 0, Math.PI * 2)
          ctx.fill()
        }
        return this
      }
    }

    Cool. So now we can create a new canvas and add an agent to it. Below you'll see me get the width and height of the
    canvas, and then multiply each of those by 0.5 to set the x and y coordinates of the agent. This just allows us to
    place the agent in the middle of the canvas (half way across the width and half way "across" the height).
  -->

  <canvas width="600" height="300" id="worldcanvas"></canvas>

  <script>

    let sim = new World(worldcanvas)
    let [w, h] = [worldcanvas.width, worldcanvas.height]
    sim.addAgent(new Agent(
      x=0.5 * w,
      y=0.5 * h,
    ))
    sim.draw()
